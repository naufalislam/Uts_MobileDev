# SDP - a scalable size unit
An android SDK that provides a new size unit - sdp (scalable dp). This size unit scales with the screen size. It can help Android developers with supporting multiple screens.

for text views please refer to [ssp](https://github.com/intuit/ssp) which is based on the sp size unit for texts. 

# Attention
Use it carefully! for example, in most cases you still need to design a different layout for tablets.

# Example
[Here](https://github.com/intuit/sdp/blob/master/sdp-android/src/main/res/layout/sdp_example.xml) is a single layout built using sdp:

![sdp example](https://github.com/intuit/sdp/blob/master/sdp_example.png)

And [here](https://github.com/intuit/sdp/blob/master/sdp-android/src/main/res/layout/dp_example.xml) is the same layout built using dp:

![dp example](https://github.com/intuit/sdp/blob/master/dp_example.png)

You can see that sdp scales with the screen size and the dp stays with the same size on all screen sizes.

# Getting Started

To add sdp to your project (Using Android Studio and Gradle): 

  add implementation 'com.intuit.sdp:sdp-android:1.0.6' to your build.gradle dependencies block.
  
  for example:
  
  ```
  dependencies {
    implementation 'com.intuit.sdp:sdp-android:1.0.6'
  }
  ```
See the [sdp_example.xml](https://github.com/intuit/sdp/blob/master/sdp-android/src/main/res/layout/sdp_example.xml) to see how to use to the sdp size unit.

For easy mapping of designs to sdp units, one can create designs with 300 pixels screen width - in this case each pixel in the design corresponds to 1 sdp.

# Note
The sdp size unit calculation includes some approximation due to some performance and usability constraints.
